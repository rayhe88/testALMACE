# Minimum version to test remote use of the almace wrapper
The file to test the wrapper is `test_OPT.py`. Inside, you will find the definition of an opt function, which receives the file's name in xyz format to be optimized and the address of the working node (host) that will carry out the evaluation.

The first lines generate the names of the trajectory files and the final xyz structure.

This wrapper needs to include information from an electronic structure code (in this case, Quantum Espresso). This information is in the dictionaries pseudo, with details on the pseudopotentials, conf_qe, and the general parameters of quantum espresso, such as the number of k points, cutting energy, functional, etc.
Finally, the kwargs dictionary contains all the information that we pass to the ALMACE wrapper, including specific execution information, such as the DFT software, its parameters, the host, the storage location, etc.
The lines below are just the invocation of an optimization via wrapper's ALMACE.

To run it, use the following instructions:
```bash
python test_OPT.py file.xyz host
```

The following is an output when `debug` takes the value `False`.


```bash
python test_OPT.py CO_Cu36.xyz x3002c0s19b0n0

When debug takes the value True, the following output allows you to find out where it is running.
